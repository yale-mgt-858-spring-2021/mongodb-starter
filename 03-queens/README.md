You're probably thinking this is a huge collection of documents.
I only want the restaurants in each neighborhood. Query to display
all the restaurants that are in the borough Queens.

Your results should look like as follows (please make sure you get only
the fields shown).


```
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "Jewish/Kosher", "name" : "Tov Kosher Kitchen" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "American ", "name" : "Brunos On The Boulevard" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "Delicatessen", "name" : "Sal'S Deli" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "Delicatessen", "name" : "Steve Chu'S Deli & Grocery" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "Ice Cream, Gelato, Yogurt, Ices", "name" : "Carvel Ice Cream" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "Chinese", "name" : "Ho Mei Restaurant" }
...
