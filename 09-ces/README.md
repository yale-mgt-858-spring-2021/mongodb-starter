Shoot, that's not it! Something with '-ces' in the name. Was the name
'Pisces'? Or maybe it was something super hipster like 'Counterbalances'?

Write a query that specifies that last three letters of the
restaurant's name as 'ces'. Similar to last time, let's exclude the
field _id. This time have the restaurant name
in descending order.

Your results should look like as follows (please make sure you get only
the fields shown).

```
{ "borough" : "Manhattan", "cuisine" : "American ", "name" : "Pieces", "restaurant_id" : "40399910" }
{ "borough" : "Manhattan", "cuisine" : "American ", "name" : "Good Shepherd Services", "restaurant_id" : "40403989" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "American ", "name" : "S.M.R Restaurant Services", "restaurant_id" : "40403857" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "Ice Cream, Gelato, Yogurt, Ices", "name" : "The Ice Box-Ralph'S Famous Italian Ices", "restaurant_id" : "40690899" }
{ "borough" : "Brooklyn", "cuisine" : "Jewish/Kosher", "name" : "Alices", "restaurant_id" : "40782042" }
{ "borough" : "Manhattan", "cuisine" : "American ", "name" : "Re: Sources", "restaurant_id" : "40876068" }
