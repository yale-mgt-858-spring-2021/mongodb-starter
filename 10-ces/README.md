Shoot, that's not it! Something with '-ces' in the name. Was the name
'Pisces'? Or maybe it was something super hipster like 'Counterbalances'?

Write a query that specifies that last three letters of the
restaurant's name as 'ces'. Similar to last time, let's exclude the
field _id. This time have the restaurant name
in descending order.
