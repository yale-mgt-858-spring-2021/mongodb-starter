Let's get a bit more specific about our restaurant choices. We are going
on a date and we only want restaurants that got at least one score above
85. Let's sort those by name and limit to the top 10.
Write a query that only displays these restaurants.

Your results should look like as follows (please make sure you get only
the fields shown).

```
{ "borough" : "Manhattan", "cuisine" : "Pizza/Italian", "name" : "Bella Napoli" }
{ "borough" : "Manhattan", "cuisine" : "Indian", "name" : "Gandhi" }
