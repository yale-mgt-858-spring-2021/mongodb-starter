Let's get a bit more specific about our restaurant choices. We are going
on a date and we only want restaurants that got at least one score above
85. Let's sort those by name.
Write a query that only displays these restaurants.

Your results should look like as follows (please make sure you get only
the fields shown).

You can find the full result [here](https://gist.github.com/lmdisch/0333e79ad0223ab4ed14143a0c670997)
