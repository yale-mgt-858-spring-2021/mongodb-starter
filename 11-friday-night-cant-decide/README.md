Darn, can't come to a decision based on our previous query. Let's just pick
based on location.

Write a query that gives restaurants in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan,
or the Bronx.

Your results should look like as follows (please make sure you get only
the fields shown).

```
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "Jewish/Kosher", "name" : "Tov Kosher Kitchen", "restaurant_id" : "40356068" }
{ "borough" : "Queens", "cuisine" : "American ", "name" : "Brunos On The Boulevard", "restaurant_id" : "40356151" }
{ "borough" : "Brooklyn", "cuisine" : "American ", "name" : "Riviera Caterer", "restaurant_id" : "40356018" }
{ "borough" : "Brooklyn", "cuisine" : "Delicatessen", "name" : "Wilken'S Fine Food", "restaurant_id" : "40356483" }
